## Quick Example

```typescript
import { Switchblade } from "@takodotid/switchblade";
import { createHonoAdapter } from "@takodotid/switchblade/adapters/hono";
import { z } from "zod";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";

const app = new Switchblade();

app.post(
    "/users",
    (req, res) => {
        const { name, email } = req.body;

        return res.status(200).json({
            id: crypto.randomUUID(),
            name,
            email,
        });
    },
    {
        body: {
            content: {
                "application/json": z.object({
                    name: z.string(),
                    email: z.string().email(),
                }),
            },
        },
        response: {
            200: {
                content: {
                    "application/json": z.object({
                        id: z.number(),
                        name: z.string(),
                        email: z.string().email(),
                    }),
                },
            },
        },
    }
);

const hono = createHonoAdapter(app);

serve(
    {
        fetch: hono.fetch,
        port: 3000,
    },
    () => console.log("Server running on http://localhost:3000")
);
